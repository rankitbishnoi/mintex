1.   I have created the forgot password api but as after the node mailer part, i had to delete my password from code for privacy reasons. so no jade is created for updating the password. i have used OTPLIB to create otp and authentication. And used nodemailer to sned the otp.

2.  Passportjs was not used for facebook login or google login niether for user nor for the seller as they do not provide all the information nedded like mobile number etc.
